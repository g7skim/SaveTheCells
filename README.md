# Save the Cells

**Save the Cells** is a WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge winner interactive scene in a Swift playground developed by Evgenii Truuts, a student at University of the People.

In this game, you have to help the cells find a way home. This game not only about fun, but it is also can help you to improve your memory.

Avoid green viruses since they can beat you. Just touch the cell and drag it into a house icon.
Try different difficulty levels.
And remember, stay home - save cells.

I made all graphic assets for this game using https://www.figma.com It was my first and so exiting experience in character development during this student challenge.
